	I'm a 15-year-old high school student (as of 2025). I'm a wannabe software engineer, and I love coding in my free time.
	I try to stick my keyboard into as many areas of programming as possible.

	<strong>My Coding Journey So Far</strong>
	I started coding when I was around 10. I began with simple python scripts, then moved on to HTML, CSS, JS.
	Over the years, I've learned various programming languages and frameworks, including Java, C, and more. However,
	my most proficient language is still Python. Moreover, I am also proficient in game development tools, such as Unity, Blender and Aseprite. 

	At age 12, I made my first game, Rocket Traffic, a simple 2D game made in Unity. It was a great learning experience, 
	and I learned a lot about game development and the game development process.

	At age 15, I made MooseOS, a 32-bit operating system. While rudimentary, it was a significant milestone in my coding 
	journey, and taught me many skills about low-level programming.
	Some other projects I have created include a web crawler, a python LLM from scratch, and Slack bot. You
	can check out my projects on my <a href="https://github.com/frogtheastronaut">GitHub</a> page.
